# React Leaflet Outdoor Maps

With TypeScript, React, and Leaflet, you can create maps with polygons, circles, rectangles, polylines, and markers on outdoor maps, and generate searchable locations. You can create event maps for any area in the world. You can search categorized areas and center them by clicking on them. It is built to be responsive and works on mobile devices. You can find screenshots below.

You are free to download, change and use it anywhere. I will regularly update this template with new resources and pages I found on the web. Don't hesitate to participate by sending a PR! Maybe your first on Github :)
