# React Leaflet Outdoor Maps

With TypeScript, React, and Leaflet:

- you can create maps with polygons, circles, rectangles, polylines, markers, popups, tooltips on outdoor maps.
- you can generate searchable locations.
- You can create event maps for any area in the world.
- You can search categorized areas and center them by clicking on them.
- You can define map boundaries and prevent navigation outside the designated area.
- You can add event and organizer logos.
- It works on mobile devices.
- Dark mode support, responsive design, and more.

You are free to download, change and use it anywhere. I will regularly update this template with new resources and pages I found on the web. Don't hesitate to participate by sending a PR! Maybe your first on Github :)
